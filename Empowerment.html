<b>Capacity Development and Enhancement</b><br>

<p>In a patriarchal society like ours, Women and Gilrls often have delevoped low self-esteem and poor thoughts about their own ability.
The women and girls has been schooled by social practices into thinking that “women are incapable, dependent and cannot be bread earners”. Such hegemony affects the girls and women and makes it hard for them to think outside of the box. Therefore, we provides different Empowerment training and sessions as a tool so that they could build up their capability, confident level, make self-analysis of their problems and search for the solutions within themselves.<br>

Our task is to help them to reshape their thoughts about themselves and help them change their lives to the better. We strive for all our beneficiaries to become confident women, with knowledge of their human rights and with the capacity to love and care for themselves.Additionlly, we also provide them counselling in need basis so that women could able to think and realize themselves as equal in male dominated society.<br>

The training consists of different topics, which help then to build confidence and enhance their capacity. lists are are followed:<br>
<ul>
<li>Women Leadership Development Training</li>
<li>Gender Development and Women Rights Training</li>
<li>Public Speaking and Communication Training</li>
<li>Entrepreneurship Development and Marketing Training</li>
</ul>

<h3> Education Support </h3><br>
<b> Women Literacy Program</b>
<p>Women constitute half of the population of Nepal, among them only 42.8% are literate. Women continue to be marginalized in various sections of the society due to inherent patriarchal culture and often miss out on education. With an aim to promote female education and encourage young girls to go to school, we provide SIWCW Scholarship schemes to poor and marginalised children. Similarly, we also provide Women Literacy Program to marginalized, illiterate women in community.</p>

<b>Scholarship to children</b>
<p>The organization tries to provide free education for poor, disadvantaged, marginalized and back ward children in coordination with different school and colleges. Sometimes, it also provides books and stationery to them.</p>
